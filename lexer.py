# first read in file

# read the file one word at a time

# make sure the word is split correctly
# for example, a token cannot have {, }, or , at the end
# so seperate out the delimiters

# first try to match delimiters

# then try to match keywords

# then try to match types

# then try to match literals (i think in the order of the grammar)

# catch any errors
